My tendency at first was to clump the words have say sleep sleeper sleepwalking sleepy slept all under one head
But the tyranny of search engines has tended to turn me into a splitter
In many cases my want of education in this field has led me astray in understanding 
or interpreting the sources and in others I ve simply bungled my notes or typed things amiss
Many readers including many academics have been kind enough to point these out
as they find them and set me right Whatever indignation they might feel at my trespass on their demesne
they appreciate the usefulness of a free ready online resource and have contributed much to make it better than I could
A NOTE ON DATES Old English manuscripts are too few and of too uncertain origin for dates to have any meaning
In Middle English this site generally makes use of the dates in the Barnhart dictionary
whose compilers gave especial attention to this period
and the online version of the University of Michigans exhaustive Middle English Dictionary
The Oxford English Dictionary is the principal source of dates in modern English up to about 1700
For the 19th and 20th centuries the OED print editions inattention to American sources begins to tell 
As recently as the 2001 printing of the hardcover 2nd edition
there was no entry for a good American word like bloviate dribble was recognized as a term in soccer but not in basketball
and the earliest citation for Dixieland music was from Punch
The OED is a monumental work rightly revered
but a suspicion arises that there might be more to the language than what is in it
The OEDs editors and stringers are constantly revising and updating their text
The recent availability of newspaper and magazine archives in computer files
and the flood of material presented in the searchable Google books project
opens a vast field for careful research
careful because the Google publications too often are misdated on the Google introduction pages
The bulk of the 19th and 20th century dates in this work have been found
or confirmed in such sources
The availability of Internet newsgroups arches again used judiciously
is a convenient way to find rough early dates for the most contemporary words
