METHODS  
This is the creation of an amateur Great care has been taken and its as accurate as I can make it  
But if youre a professional linguist or a serious student of linguistics you shouldnt be doing your homework here  
This is for the rest of us 
Etymonline is compiled from published sources and in some points from original material made available on the Internet  
The first step was to draw up a list of English words out of an ordinary dictionary and seek their etymologies 
To compile an entry I look up the word in my major sources the Oxford English Dictionary second edition  
the Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology 1988 Weekleys Etymological Dictionary of Modern English 1921  
and Ernest Kleins Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language 1971 
In most cases all of these offered substantially the same derivations  
My work was to merge them and put them into a consistent and accessible format  
In some cases one text offered information where others were silent  
Ive erred on the side of inclusion In a few cases they differed significantly in their derivations  
Ive tried to indicate that In some cases they varied in their descriptions of the precise path a word took through Latin and French to English  
I have not always indicated these differences 
The next step was to take the draft entry to my secondary shelf of sources  
principally dictionaries of Old English Middle English Latin Greek French and etymology dictionaries for French Gamillscheg  
German Kluge Greek Beekes and Latin de Vaan  
From these I attempted to flesh out the entries and give them some nuance and answer some questions  
I had about words that the big books did not notice 
For slang and colloquial usage I consult the Kipfer/Chapman Dictionary of American Slang  
which despite its title embraces many Britishisms DARE and Farmer  
And for navigating the back alleys of English I had as a lantern the always delightful  
Dictionary of Buckish Slang University Wit and Pickpocket Eloquence  
The modern definitions are largely from or adopted from the excellent Century Dictionary 18891902 
The list of books on the secondary shelf has changed somewhat since the work began  
At the start I made use of a couple of books which seemed authoritative but eventually revealed themselves to be  
whimsical or worse One was so deadly it became the only book Ive ever destroyed as a menace to society  
Ive tried to weed out the bad seeds they left in this work Its possible a few remain 
Originally I did not intend to include ProtoIndoEuropean roots in part because there was such wide disagreement  
among the sources I consulted in part because the whole field seems so speculative  
But users wrote to me seeking them so Ive added them to the best of my ability  
mainly based on the Watkins American Heritage Dictionary of IndoEuropean Roots  
but also by consulting Pokorny and such modern works as are available for Latin Greek and Germanic  
in the Leiden IndoEuropean Etymological Dictionary Series see sources 
With many words root meanings or sense evolutions remain obscure 
I would be content to leave them as such  
but readers are curious to know what guesses have been made or dismissed by the experts  
as well as what facts have been settled 
So Ive included such speculations that have appeared in the sources I consulted  
They ought to be prefaced by perhaps in this text even where the sources say probably
