Ther was also a Nonne a Prioresse
That of hir smylyng was ful symple and coy
Hire gretteste ooth was but by seinte Loy 
And she was cleped madame Eglentyne 
Ful weel she soong the service dyvyne 
Entuned in hir nose ful semely
And Frenssh she spak ful faire and fetisly
After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe
For Frenssh of Parys was to hire unknowe
At mete wel y-taught was she with-alle
She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle
Ne wette hir fyngres in hir sauce depe 
Wel koude she carie a morsel and wel kepe 
Thát no drope ne fille upon hire brist
In curteisie was set ful muchel hir list
Hire over-lippe wyped she so clene 
That in hir coppe ther was no ferthyng sene 
Of grece whan she dronken hadde hir draughte 
Ful semely after hir mete she raughte
And sikerly she was of greet desport
And ful plesáunt and amyable of port
And peyned hire to countrefete cheere 
Of court and been estatlich of manere 
And to ben holden digne of reverence
But for to speken of hire conscience 
She was so charitable and so pitous 
She wolde wepe if that she saugh a mous 
Kaught in a trappe if it were deed or bledde
Of smale houndes hadde she, that she fedde 
With rosted flessh or milk and wastel breed 
But soore wepte she if oon of hem were deed 
Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte
And al was conscience and tendre herte
Ful semyly hir wympul pynched was
Hire nose tretys her eyen greye as glas 
Hir mouth ful smal and ther-to softe and reed
But sikerly she hadde a fair forheed
It was almoost a spanne brood I trowe
For, hardily she was nat undergrowe
Ful fetys was hir cloke as I was war 
Of smal coral aboute hire arm she bar 
A peire of bedes gauded al with grene
And ther-on heng a brooch of gold ful sheene
On which ther was first write a crowned A
And after Amor vincit omnia
Another Nonne with hire hadde she 
That was hire chapeleyne and Preestes thre 
A Monk ther was a fair for the maistrie
An outridere that lovede venerie
A manly man to been an abbot able
Ful many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable
And whan he rood men myghte his brydel heere 
Gýnglen in a whistlynge wynd als cleere
And eek as loude as dooth the chapel belle
Ther as this lord was kepere of the celle
The reule of seint Maure or of seint Beneit
By-cause that it was old and som-del streit
This ilke Monk leet olde thynges pace
And heeld after the newe world the space
He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen 
That seith that hunters ben nat hooly men
Ne that a monk, whan he is recchelees
Is likned til a fissh that is waterlees
This is to seyn a monk out of his cloystre
But thilke text heeld he nat worth an oystre
And I seyde his opinioun was good
What sholde he studie and make hymselven wood
Upon a book in cloystre alwey to poure 
Or swynken with his handes and labóure
As Austyn bit How shal the world be served 
Lat Austyn have his swynk to him reserved
Therfore he was a prikasour aright 
Grehoundes he hadde as swift as fowel in flight 
Of prikyng and of huntyng for the hare 
Was al his lust for no cost wolde he spare 
I seigh his sleves y-púrfiled at the hond 
With grys and that the fyneste of a lond
And for to festne his hood under his chyn 
He hadde of gold y-wroght a curious pyn 
A love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was
His heed was balled that shoon as any glas 
And eek his face as he hadde been enoynt 
He was a lord ful fat and in good poynt
His eyen stepe and rollynge in his heed 
That stemed as a forneys of a leed 
His bootes souple his hors in greet estaat 
Now certeinly he was a fair prelaat 
He was nat pale as a forpyned goost
A fat swan loved he best of any roost 
His palfrey was as broun as is a berye
